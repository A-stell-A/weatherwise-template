Me: Can you write a Python function that returns the current weather forecast for a given city using the OpenWeather Map API?
AI: import requests
import json

BASE_URL = "https://openweathermap.org/weathermap?basemap=map&cities=true&layer=temperature&lat=42.6824&lon=-33.9697&zoom=5"
API_KEY = "9e58001aecb184f42bbfe60f3ce9751e"

# custom weather forecast function
def find_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """This function returns the current weather forecast for the given city"""
    units = "metric"
    params = {
        'q': city,
        'appid': API_KEY,
        'units': units
    }
    response = requests.get(BASE_URL, params=params)
    result = response.json()

    return result

My Analysis of the AI Response
1. The BASE_URL is for the OpenWeatherMap visual weather map, not the Current Weather Data API. It won't return city weather data as expected.
2. lat and long are fixed in the URL but shouldn't be for a function taking city names.
3. The API key is hardcoded and publicly exposed in the script. While this is fine for a demo, in real apps it shuold be stored securely.
4. If the request fails or the city is not found, the function may raise an exception or return unclear results.

Me: I think the API endpoint was wrong and I want better error handling too. Can you fix the code to use the correct OpenWeatherMap endpoint and include basic error handling?
AI: import requests

API_KEY = "9e58001aecb184f42bbfe60f3ce9751e"
BASE_URL = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"

def find_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Returns the current weather for a given city from OpenWeatherMap."""
    params = {
        'q': city,
        'appid': API_KEY,
        'units': 'metric'
    }

    try:
        response = requests.get(BASE_URL, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()  # raises exception for 4xx/5xx responses
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
        return {"error": f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}"}
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        return {"error": f"Request failed: {err}"}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}"}

Why My FollowuUp Prompt Was Effective
1. I identified the exact problem with the endpoint and suggested an area of improvement in error handling.
2. Instead of being vague, I gave a concreate goal: fic the endpoint and add error handling.
3. My prompt built on the initial attempt, helping guide the AI to refine rather than start from scratch.
